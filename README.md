# Story Dice Generator

This is a small project I did for a writing task my B1 students had to complete: a simple, interactive web-based dice.

By clicking the **"Roll the Dice"** button, the application randomly pairs a popular character (in this case from Shrek and Harry Potter) with a hobby, generating a "prompt" for the students to write their own stories.

## Features
- **Randomized Combinations:** Generates a character and a hobby simultaneously.

## Built With
- **HTML5:** For the page structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including custom fonts and layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For the randomization logic and DOM manipulation.

## Project Structure

- **Images:** I don't own any of the images in this project as it was a quick work-around to make a writing exercise more interactive. The frog wizard pixel art belongs to 508meaw8 on [dinopixel](https://dinopixel.com/frog-with-wizard-hat-pixel-art-18891).
